# SpaceXx-Virtual-Reality-Game
Combat Game
My temate and I developed a virtual reality game in which players embarked on a quest to retrieve a vital orb and prevent reality from being annihilated by the nefarious super-villain, Malvus. Players were armed with a variety of weapons, a protective shield, and an arsenal of unique attacks, all essential for their journey. To emerge victorious in the game, players had to conquer a horde of formidable minions and ultimately confront the highly intelligent villain, Malvus, in an epic battle of wits and skill.
